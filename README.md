This repository serves to store the knowledge I accumulate through extensive reading during our research in an organized structure. See this as my second brain where you can follow thoughts from weeks ago and connect them to recent paper reads. Obsidian features so-called [[backlinks]] that are super useful to organize and connect your thoughts.

To gain full functionality, you might want to use the [Obsidian app](https://obsidian.md/).
However, all notes are readable in this repository also.

This repository is inspired by the research notes from [Terry Ruas](https://github.com/truas/research_notes). Thanks for helping me out!
