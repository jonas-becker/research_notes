### Major Contributions

- Scenarios of strategic reasoning: 
	- Society, Economics, Game Theory, Gaming
- Methods to elict strategic reasoning: 
	- Prompt Engineering: 
		- [[Chain-of-Thought]], [[In-context Learning]]
	- Module Enhancement: 
		- external modlules, e.g., retrieving external knowledge
	- Theory of Mind:
		- enables agents to anticipate on mental states of others
	- Fine-tuning
		- reinforcement learning and imitation learning
- Characteristics of strategic reasoning:
	- Goal-oriented, interactivity, predictive nature, adaptability
- Evaluation:
	- controlled enviroments
	- quanitative analysis
		- through metrics that target the LLMs ability to perceive, predict, adapt.
	- qualitative analysis
		- on deception, cooperation, discernment, etc

### Secondary Contribution

- Strategic reasoning: Differs from reasoning in dynamism of the reasoning environment and the uncertainty of adversary actions

---
### Limitations/Future Work

- the application of LLMs in strategic reasoning risks being haphazard, potentially overlooking critical insights into the model’s capabilities, decision-making processes, and potential biases or shortcomings
- absence of unified benchmarks
- question remains whether scaling up—merely increasing the number of parameters and the volume of training data for a general-purpose LLM—alone could suffice for general-purpose LLMs to fully master strategic reasoning
